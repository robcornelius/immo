## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

# If I had time...

I have had a very busy weekend. I am writing this at 1:02am on Sunday. Personal things, I hope you understand. Anyway...

I would have added some cypress tests to do the following 
* entering a string in the search box
* hitting enter
* checking you get the correct number of results back
* using a filter
* checking the correct number of results are show
* clicking a checkbox or two
* checking the right details are in the top table
* unchecking a previously checked checkbox
* checking the right details are in the top table

also 
* some more traditional unit tests to test your api is playing nicely
* unit tests for the logic regarding the checkboxs
* anything else I could think of
